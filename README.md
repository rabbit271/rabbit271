Hello everyone! My name is Kien, full name is Thai Trung Kien. You can call me Rabbit. I am passionate about analyzing numbers and insights about them.

I studied at Hanoi University of Pharmacy. That sounds totally non-related to my passion, doesn't it? However, here I have taught myself to be determined, long-suffering, thorough, and precise in my reasoningâ€”qualities that are crucial when dealing with data.

After completing a rigorous 5-year Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) program, I have built a solid foundation in the pharmaceutical sciences. However, my true passion lies in Information Technology, particularly Data Analytics. Following my pharmacy studies, I decided to pivot my career toward this field. I am now fully committed to this transition and am focusing all my efforts on becoming an expert in Data Analytics.
